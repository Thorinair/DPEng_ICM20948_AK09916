# DPEng_ICM20948_AK09916
DPEng's Arduino library for the ICM-20948 breakout board with magnetometer calibration and AHRS examples. Credit to Adafruit for the general library structure. There are plans to translate the popular MPU-9250 Kris Winer library for this device too.

DPEng's ICM-20948 Breakout Board is specically developed for this library with 3 - 5V input with I2C and SPI voltage translation, I'm pleased to announce it is coming very soon!

PLEASE NOTE: Amazon and Ebay links will be provided here when the DPEng ICM 20948 Breakout Board is released so it is highly recommended to watch this repository to receive an update when it is in stock!!

Additional Libraries Required 
The Adafruit Senor library is required.
